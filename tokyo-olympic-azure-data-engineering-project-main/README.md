## Setup and Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Priyankareddy2410/olympics_data_azure.git
   cd olympics_data_azure
Install the required Python packages:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open Tokyo Olympic Transformation.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to see the data transformation steps.

Data Transformation
The data transformation is performed using a Jupyter Notebook and Python scripts. The main steps involved are:

Data Ingestion:

Loading raw data files into the Azure environment.
Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
Data Transformation:

Aggregating data, creating new features, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.
Analysis
The analysis involves:

Descriptive statistics of the dataset.
Visualization of medal counts by country.
Analysis of athlete performance and demographics.
Results
The results of the analysis provide insights into the performance of different countries and athletes during the Tokyo Olympics. Key findings and visualizations are included in the Jupyter Notebook.
